1. [Object Recognition](https://github.com/JinhoLee93/Computer_Vision/tree/main/object_recognition)
- Recognizes objects based on their 2-D properties.
2. [Edge Detection](https://github.com/JinhoLee93/Computer_Vision/tree/main/edge_detection)
- Detects edges using [Hough Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform).
3. [Panoramic Image App](https://github.com/JinhoLee93/Computer_Vision/blob/main/panoramic_image_app/README.md)
- Combines three images in order to make one panoramic image using [feature detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(computer_vision)).
4. [Photometric Stereo](https://github.com/JinhoLee93/Computer_Vision/tree/main/photometric_stereo)
- Reconstructs the surface of an object by using [Photometric Stereo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometric_stereo).
5. [Refocus App](https://github.com/JinhoLee93/Computer_Vision/tree/main/refocus_app)
- Finds focus using [Depth from Focus/Defocus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-fgaR7vJ-w) (Professor Nayar has an [awesome YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf0WB91t8Ky6AuYcQV0CcLw) for CV education! Please check it out!)
6. [Tracking Object](https://github.com/JinhoLee93/Computer_Vision/tree/main/tracking_object)
- Tracks an object in an image stack (frames) by calculating the [Optical Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow) of the object.
