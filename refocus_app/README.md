# Refocus App

Written by Jinho Lee (jl5027@columbia.edu)

This application will focus wherever in a scene the user clicks. To illustrate the purpose better, check out my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/qJmX-NFqSr0) to see how this app works.

I've implemented depth from focus/defocus to create this app. So, what is "depth from focus/defocus?"
- To find depth from focus, take images with different focus settings by moving the sensor. When it comes to the best focused image, we want to use that image to get the correct depth of the scene using Gaussian Lens Law.
