# Refocus App

Written by Jinho Lee (jl5027@columbia.edu)

This application will focus wherever in a scene the user clicks. To illustrate the purpose better, check out my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/qJmX-NFqSr0) to see how this app works.

I've implemented depth from focus/defocus to create this app. So, what is "depth from focus/defocus?"
